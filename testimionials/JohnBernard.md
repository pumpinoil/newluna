# Testimonial by John Bernard

> There are moments in your life when you know everything has changed forever.
>
> My work with Luna has been a series of those moments—a remarkable manifestation of enlightenment. If there is something in life to be truly grateful for, it is meeting her and having the opportunity to grow under her guidance.
>
> Things tend to become unstable and unmanageable without listening to and being in touch with myself. I have always struggled to connect with others, and the farthest person from me, I felt, was myself. Interestingly, before meeting Luna, I wrote a letter about how lost I was. This lack of self-understanding and ignorance was something Luna helped cure.
>
> I am the ultimate skeptic, someone who treads on the side of doubt, fact-checking everything to come to my own conclusions. Yet, I have never trusted anyone as much as I trust Luna. She has been the only person to make me feel like I am not alone, helping me realize I am never alone—that I am everything, that we are everything. There is a fire burning inside each of us, and that fire is the same one that burns in the universe.
>
> The things you learn from Luna are not things you can read in a book or learn from any teacher. This knowledge is conveyed through intentions woven together in a fantastic formula for self-liberation, lifting the restraints that tell you it’s impossible, that you can’t do it. I am here to testify that it is possible, that anything is possible, because right inside you is the greatest power in the universe—and that’s infinite love.
>
> Ultimately, Luna’s guidance has culminated in self-awareness, stewardship, and a renewed sense of purpose. I am forever grateful for her presence in my life, for the opportunity to grow and learn from her, for the chance to be a better person, and most importantly, to be myself. I am forever grateful for Luna.
>
> - There are some things that can be considered gifts, and there are some things that can be considered miracles. Luna is a miracle.
